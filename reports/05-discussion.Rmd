# Discussion

- FU in GM is much longer than 20 years
- Exclusion restriction on $H$ so that its parents do not include $A$ is not necessary for identification in full data
- Exclusion restriction on $D$ so that its parents do not include $H$ not needed if $H$ is observed and conditioned upon
- Not clear if these were for convenience or what
- What if we increase FU? Lags?
- Greater fineness in exposure definition? Different interventions?
- No way to verify to what extent the simulation informs the real data generating system
- Model specification, double robustness
